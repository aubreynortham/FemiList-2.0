# The FemiList 2.0\*

If you are someone who wants to Netflix and chill but also challenge the patriarchy at the same time, then the FemiList is for you. This project is inspired by my interest in media representations of gender (and my inclination to share that interest with anyone willing to listen).

The FemiList allows users to search by movie title to see general information about a film in addition to its Bechdel rating, which rates a film based on female character development.

\* New and improved! This is a revamp of my original [FemiList](https://github.com/aubreynortham/FemiList) app built in 2016. The intention behind 2.0 is to refactor with modern React practices and updated UI.

## API Integrations

Two separate third-party APIs are used to gather this app's data. The documentation for those can be found here:

Open Movie Database (OMDb API) http://www.omdbapi.com/

Bechdel Test API http://bechdeltest.com/api/v1/doc

## Project Development and Hosting

Run a local build of the project with `npm start`.

Project is hosted at https://aubreynortham.com/FemiList-2.0/
